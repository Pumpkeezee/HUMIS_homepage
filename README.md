# HUMIS Homepage Project

*Josiah Teske*

This project mimics the layout of an old iteration of the
University of Utah Department of History webpage.

This project contains:
- an index.html file for the webpage
- a stylesheet.css file to set up the
layout of the webpage
- this README.md file to explain the project
- an assets folder that contains all additional
project media.

This project taught me the essentials of using HTML and CSS
to create websites, including how to structure code efficiently
and use CSS stylesheets to make things look like I want.
